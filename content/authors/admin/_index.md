In the summer of 2008, he moved to Xiamen, Fujian, China, where he completed his final year of primary school and six years of secondary school. He received his B.Eng. degree in telecommunication engineering from Tiangong University, Tianjin, China, in 2019. He is currently pursuing his Ph.D. degree in ocean technology and engineering with the Ocean College, Zhejiang University, Zhoushan, China, under the supervision of Professor Fengzhong Qu and co-supervision of Professor Yan Wei. His research interests include underwater communications, cross-medium communication, distributed acoustic sensing, and ocean observation.

Ethan chose the name "Ethan" for informal and personal use, though "Shaojian Yang" is used in formal documents. Outside of academia, he enjoys traveling, reading, and connecting with people from diverse backgrounds. He has lived in or visited 64 cities across 23 of China's 34 provincial-level regions and has also traveled to Japan and Australia.
