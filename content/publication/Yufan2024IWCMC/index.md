abstract: The archipelagic environment is an important feature of island distribution. The archipelago environment, an important feature of island distribution, allows for more wireless communication nodes to be deployed, which helps achieve large-scale network coverage at sea. This provides communication convenience for real-time and 3-dimensional oceanographic observations. On the other hand, air-sea-ground networking should overcome the complex communication conditions brought by the archipelago and shallow water. In this article, we propose an air-sea-ground integrated observation system based on ad hoc network. It combines underwater acoustic communications and LoRa communications to construct an air-sea-ground transmission system. The core equipment of this system includes the scientific instrument interface module (SIIM), LoRa relay node, and underwater acoustic communication (UAC) modem. The UAC Modem and LoRa used as communication modules are connected to various ocean observation sensors through the SIIM. Opportunistic routing and transmission control are implemented by embedded chip programming. The system has been tested on Zhairuoshan Island, Zhoushan Archipelagoes, China, and the transmission success rate exceeds 90%. The preliminary verification proves the effectiveness of the proposed system, which is of great significance to marine scientific research, environmental protection, and marine economic development.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary:  Our findings reveal the successful establishment of a direct acoustic communication link between the water and air interface, achieving a data rate of 4.565 kbps.
