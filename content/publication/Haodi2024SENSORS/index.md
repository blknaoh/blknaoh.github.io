abstract: Communication is crucial for underwater telemetry with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). Traditional seabed-station-based communication methods face challenges due to high costs and limited range. Utilizing distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and quantum sensing technologies, we propose a novel solution for bidirectional communication via submarine cables. AUVs can transmit data through existing submarine cables without surfacing or additional seabed stations. Sea trials show that our solution achieves an uplink rate of approximately 1117 bps and a downlink rate of approximately 7.2 bps. The integrated acoustic-optic-magnetic sensing solution enables AUVs to perform telemetry through submarine cables, expanding their operational scenarios.
