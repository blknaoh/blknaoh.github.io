abstract: The ocean environment is characterized by its volatility and hostility, making data transmission underwater difficult. The introduction of edge computing offers a mitigation solution by moving computing power closer to the data sources, reducing the cost of data transmission. In the field of edge computing, offloading computing tasks have long been challenging, especially in the ocean environment. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a specific edge computing offloading strategy to address the computational challenges in the ocean environment. Subsequently, we apply the whale optimization algorithm (WOA) to tackle the data offloading issue between underwater sensors and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). In this process, optimization performance is evaluated in terms of minimizing latency and energy loss. Our simulation results validate the feasibility of the offloading strategy based on whale optimization algorithm and also demonstrate the lowest overall integrated energy consumption of the system compared with other mainstream methods. Considering the extremely low consumption of the algorithm, the WOA is believed to be a promising method of offloading strategy for ocean edge computing.
